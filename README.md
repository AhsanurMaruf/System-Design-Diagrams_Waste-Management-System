# ðŸ“˜ Waste Management System Architecture & Design Diagrams

This repository contains a collection of **system design and architecture diagrams** created using [Draw.io (diagrams.net)](https://draw.io).  
The diagrams were originally developed as part of my **Bachelor Thesis Project** and also serve as valuable references for **Software Quality Assurance (QA)** activities, such as system understanding, test planning, and impact analysis.
